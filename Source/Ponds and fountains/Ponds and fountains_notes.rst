Ponds and fountains
=====================
2020-09-15: Building a pond again for the First time in many years. This time round it is focussed on encouraging  wild life
2002-04-26: had to fix all the fountains, including buying a new pump for one of the fountains where the pump was run dry in the winter, and burnt the pump. Although water fountains looks great and the sound of water is so soothing, it is really quite an effort to keep all the fountains going, let alone the cost of running all the fountains. I think I am going to put time switches on most of the pump sockets.
2002-03-30: The motor of the large fountain at the back stopped working - and it seems a rather big job to get it fixed. Although the water features all look really great, I realise that the water features all requires a lot of maintenance, and one or other thing is most of the time wrong, with the result that the waterfeatures are often not working.
2002-03-26: I took the net off the pond as the plants started to grow through the net, and I saw the wild ducks around. I have not yet spotted the ducks on the pond. I also took some care to put a barrier around the pond for Joshua. He is very keen to see the fish, and through all sorts of things into the pond. I am really concerned to make sure that he does not climb onto the dam wall. The barrier should prevent this.
1999-05-02: I decided to buy some fountains and put them in the garden, one in front at the front door with little animals and draped in plants, the other with two children standing under an umbrella. With great effort we got this fountain installed at the centre of the back garden.

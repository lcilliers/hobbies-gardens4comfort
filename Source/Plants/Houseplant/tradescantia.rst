wandering jew purple heart
----------------------------
Commonly called purple secretia, purple-heart or purple queen. It is native to the Gulf Coast region of eastern Mexico. Edward Palmer collected the type specimen near Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas in 1907.  Feng Shui designers say that those who place the plant in the front of ones home are brought prosperity and good Karma.  Widely used as an ornamental plant in gardens and borders, as a ground cover, hanging plant, or - particularly in colder climates where it cannot survive the winter season - houseplant, it is propagated easily by cuttings (the stems are visibly segmented and roots will frequently grow from the joints).  As a houseplant, T. pallida has been judged exceptionally effective at improving indoor air quality by filtering out volatile organic compounds, a class of common pollutants and respiratory irritants, an effect known as phytoremediation.   Cuttings are very easy to grow.Remove the bottom few leaves and place in warm, moist soil. New growth will appear within 1-1.5 months. Remember these plants like it warm and bright

howea
-------
Howea, evergreen feather palms, also occasionally seen under their old name of kentia.  Requires a winter minimum temperature of 50F. Leaves must be misted regularly. Needs good light, but not direct sun through glass. Tollerates some shade.  Water moderately in summer and sparingly in winter. Keep the soil just moist.  Feed in summer. The plant benefits from standing outside in a light summer shower.

This specimen of Howea forsteriana, paradise palm, (I think) was introduced in the house in Q3 2000. It is standing in the far corner of the lounge, where it is quite dark.  We need to monitor it very carefully.

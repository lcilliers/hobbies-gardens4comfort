alocasia kris plant
---------------------
Alocasia sanderiana, commonly known as the kris plant, is a plant in the family Araceae. It is endemic to Misamis Occidental and Bukidnon, in the Philippines. It is classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The Alocasia, Kris Plant or Elephants ear, is distinctly uncommon.  They certainly arouse attention with long erect stems bearing enormous arrow-shaped leaves with pale-coloured veins. Unfortunately these spectacular plants are not really happy in the living room and need to return to greenhouse conditions after a few months.  Temperature needs are warm, above 70F in summer and 65F in winter. Light bright in winter, and semi-shade in summer. Keep moist at all times, but water sparingly in winter. Mist leaves very frequently

Propagation Notes
-------------------

 - Plant Type: Houseplant  - Propagation:   - Hardiness: Indoors  - Flowering Season:  
Repot in early spring every year, dividing plant at repotting time
This plant, A. Amazonica,  was introduced in Q3 2000 and is in the lounge close to the window. It has produced two small leaves from the base during the January, February.
Repotted this plant in 2001. It almost died, and did not want to make new leaves for the whole year. However, we moved it to a new location in the conservatory and now it is really starting to look very good. It had several flowers and made many more leaves.
This plant finally past away in the winter of 2002-2003. It was probably related to watering

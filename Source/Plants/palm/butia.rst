jelly palm
------------
From Brazil, one of the hardiest feather (as opposed to fan-) palms, Butia will withstand -10º or -12ºC when larger. Beautiful blue-green leaves, strongly recurved, make it instantly recognisable. An essential palm for the exotic garden. Tolerant of the weather in high rainfall regions. Also wonderful as a conservatory palm, or even indoors if the light is bright enough. Ultimately it can grow to about 10 or 20 feet, though this will take some years.

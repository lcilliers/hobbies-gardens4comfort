Chusan palm
-------------
The most popular and one of the hardiest palms for the temperate garden. Big, fan-shaped leaves atop a spectacular, hairy trunk add a bizarre and tropical touch to any planting. For maximum growth, feed and water well; it can achieve a foot of trunk or more per year. Otherwise just let nature take its course and it will grow just as well, albeit more slowly. Its main enemy is not cold (which it laughs at, down to -15ºC!) but wind, which can damage its 36 diameter leaves. From China, it has been popular in this country for a hundred and fifty years. If you only have one palm in your garden, this should be it. Plant out in sun or shade, at any time except winter, and water well in dry weather

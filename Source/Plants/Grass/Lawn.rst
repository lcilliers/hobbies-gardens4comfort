Lawn
------
the lawn is as much a plant as any other plant.

All lawns need feeding in order to maintain vigour. When feeding, look out for signs of pest or disease and apply moss killer if required. Regular maintenance is the best way to approach a lawn, and may avoid the need for renovation later on.

Over winter, the lawn does not grow much, but once the weather warms up in early spring, you can start mowing, and this is also a good time to over-seed any areas damaged over winter.

2024-01-06: Spent sime time forking sections of the lawn.  For the past two winters and did some forking on different areas of the lawn and the improvement of the lawn is quite remarkable, especially in high traffic areas
2023-06-15: This is the first year that I can see the remarkable difference in the lawn after cutting regularly with the mulcher. It is very evident that the cuttings are feeding the lawn throughout the season, with limited need to further fertilize the lawn.
2021-05-12: Purchased a lawn mower mulcher.
2002-10-19: I gave the grass for the first time a autumn feed with fertilizer. Would be interesting to see what is the result.

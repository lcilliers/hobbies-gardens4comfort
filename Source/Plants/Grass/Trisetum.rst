Golden oat grass
------------------
Trisetum flavescens, the yellow oatgrass or golden oat grass, is a species of grass in the family Poaceae. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.

It can be found elsewhere, such as sections of North America, where it was introduced as a rangeland grass for grazing.[2] It now exists in the wild as a common weed.

Trisetum flavescens is a perennial bunchgrass growing in clumps up to 60–80 centimetres (24–31 in) tall, and known to exceed 1 metre (3.3 ft) at times.

The inflorescence is a narrow panicle which is greenish yellow to purple when new and ages to bright golden yellow.[

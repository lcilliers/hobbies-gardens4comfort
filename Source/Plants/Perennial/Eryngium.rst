Eryngium
==========

Eryngium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. There are about 250 species. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, with the center of diversity in South America. Common names include eryngo and sea holly. These are annual and perennial herbs with hairless and usually spiny leaves

Eryngium maritimum, the sea holly or seaside eryngo, is a species of Eryngium in the plant family Apiaceae and native to most European coastlines. It resembles a plume thistle in that its flower is burr-shaped, but the flowers are metallic blue rather than mauve.

Eryngium pandanifolium, also known as pandan-like-leaved eryngo, is an impressive herbaceous perennial. It forms a dense clump of large, sword-shaped, spiny-margined blue-green leaves, reaching up to 1.5 meters in height. During late summer, it produces tall stems (up to 2.5 meters) with axillary branches, bearing numerous small, round, purplish-grey flower heads. These flowers may mature to chocolate brown if not affected by frost

Propagation Notes
-------------------

Most deciduous erygniums set viable seed. This should be sown in late-summer and autumn and will germinate in the following spring. Plant out young sea hollies in the following autumn or spring. Seedlings may vary.

Plant eryngiums where there is bright light, poor soil and good drainage in order to develop a strong, rigid framework and steely patina. If grown on damp, heavy soil (or in wetter parts of the country) most eryngiums stems tend to flop and become a dull, grey-green.

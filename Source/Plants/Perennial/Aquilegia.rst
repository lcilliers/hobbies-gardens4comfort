This plant is native to Switzerland, it will produce nodding flowers which are delicate but sturdy. The flowers are lavender-blue with lavender-blue sepals but sometimes the tube of the flower will be very pale blue or white. This wildflower does best in moist, well drained soil. They are easy to grow and flower in spring or early summer. Store seeds in the refrigerator for 3 weeks before sowing. When sowing, do not cover the seeds, as they need light for germination and will germinate best at a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees. Keep well watered. Of the 65 Aquilegia species, this is one of the finest and most rewarding to grow.

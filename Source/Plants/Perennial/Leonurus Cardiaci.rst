Motherwort is an herbaceous perennial that is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which includes mint. Similar to this strongly fragranced plant, motherwort also has a unique aroma when bruised or crushed.

This plant produces deeply toothed, ragged leaves and small, pink or purple flowers that appear in the summer. The lower leaves have five lobes while the upper leaves have three lobes. The uppermost leaves only have one lobe, giving this plant a unique tiered appearance. This plant is used to attract pollinators and add unique beauty to a garden. Take note that motherwort is a very fast grower and can be invasive.

Propagation Notes
-------------------



 - Plant Type: Perennial 
 - Propagation: Seed 
 - Hardiness: Hardy H5-H1 (<-10) 
 - Flowering Season: Summer to autumn 

Motherwort grows well from seeds, making it another great method of propagation. To grow seeds, cold stratification is required. Soak the seeds for up to 24 hours in water, then move them to a plastic bag with damp sand or peat moss and place them in the refrigerator. Leave in the refrigerator for one to two weeks. After this, the seeds are ready to plant.

Because of their fast growth rate, these plants do well when seeds are sown directly into the garden. To do this, simply broadcast the seeds over well-draining soil in the late spring or late fall, then cover them lightly with 1/8 inch of soil.

Motherwort grows rapidly and spreads through underground rhizomes. This makes division a quick and simple way to propagate this plant. Division is best done yearly to prevent motherwort from spreading out of control. To do this, you will need a garden shovel, gloves, and a sharp pair of garden snips.

Betonica officinalis Betony
-----------------------------

An upright perennial with scalloped, oblong leaves and dense terminal spikes of reddish-purple flowers in summer and early autumn

Betonica officinalis (recently changed from Stachys officinalis) is a British native perennial wildflower, with delightful purple-red blooms and fresh green, toothed foliage. It's typically found in grasslands and hedgerows, but does well in gardens. It's most commonly known as betony, but it's other common names include: common hedgenettle, purple betony, wood betony, bishopwort, or bishop's wort. Like other members of the dead nettle (Lamiaceae) family, betony can be identified by its square stems and lipped flowers, which are a magnet for bees and other pollinators.

bergenia, elephant's ear, large rockfoil
------------------------------------------

Cool temperatures bring a ruby flesh of the leathery leaves of  the Bergenia Cordifolia in the winter.  This tough evergreen is softens the stark edges and thrives in the shade.  These Bergenias are planted in a long container on the driveway

They are clump-forming, rhizomatous, evergreen perennials with a spirally arranged rosette of leaves 6–35 cm long and 4–15 cm broad, and pink flowers produced in a cyme.[2] The leaves are large, leathery, ovate or cordate, and often have wavy or saw-toothed edges. For most of the year, the leaves have a glossy green colour, but in cooler climates, they turn red or bronze in the fall. The flowers grow on a stem similar in colour to a rhubarb stalk and most varieties have cone-shaped flowers in varying shades of pink. These can range from almost white to ruby red and purple.

These easy-to-grow, evergreen perennials really earn their keep, making a year-round contribution to borders. Their large leathery leaves, often tinged red in winter, make attractive ground cover, while the flowers are an early bounty for pollinating insects. They combine well with other spring flowers in shade or sun.

It originates from southern Europe east to central Asia but is now a common garden escape throughout Europe. It is a low, spreading plant, hardy, evergreen and perennial, with small violet, pink or white flowers, and inhabits rocks and banks.

Propagation Notes
-------------------

 - Plant Type: Perennial 
 - Propagation: Division 
 - Hardiness: Semi Hardy H6 (-10) 
 - Flowering Season: Spring 

You can divide aubrieta in early fall to increase your stock. Dig the plant, and tease the clump apart with your hands or a garden fork. Replant the divisions 12 inches apart.
Sow by just covering the seed, from late winter to early summer, in a good free draining seed compost.
Add some grit or sharp sand to ordinary compost as Aubretia doesn’t like wet feet.
Make sure the compost is moist and not wet and seal in a polythene bag.
Germination usually takes 14-21 days at 65F .

2024-03-02: There is a few containers with aubrietas in. I overwintered them better this winter but it looks as if I need to plant into the containers as some of the plants in the pots did not make it.  I am not yet seeing any evidence of self seeding.

2024-03-01: Sow some more aubrietas to fill into the pots and beds.Put under glass and ensure the seeds are not too wet from the bottom.

2023-09-15: The aubrietas planted out into the sunny ledge did well in spots and in others in died out.  I think the soil is not moist enough in those spots.  The plants in the pots did well for the early season, especially on the stairs in front.

2023-06-18: Planted out a few aubrietas that survived in the greenhouse into a bed

2023-04-15: 4 pods of aubrieta germinated and is ready to pot on

2023-04-02: sow 4 more pods of aubrieta to fill into existing pots

anemone
=========

A very frost hardy species. This is the most commonly planted Anemone. The leaves are deeply divided and lobed. Flowers are usually brilliantly coloured and can come in single or double flowering varieties, depending upon the strain or cultivar you choose. Extremely popular as a cut flower for florist's shops, hence one of its common names. Plant your tubers 2 inches deep in the spring if you are in a cold area or in the autumn in warmer climates. Staggered plantings will prolong your blooming season. You may need to protect your plants from intense midday sun in high humidity areas and from cold with a cloche. 'St. Brigid single' and 'de Caen semi-double' are highly recommended strains of this species

anemone blanda Mountain windflower
------------------------------------

Native to Greece and Turkey, this is a delicate-looking very early-blooming, hardy tuber. It brings lovely daisy-like flowers to the early spring landscape and lacy fern-like foliage which covers the ground with an airy delicacy. An excellent companion for all other spring bulbs, tulips and daffodils in particular, this Anemone provides low and spreading cover for the bulb bed. Self-seeds freely, given moist, slightly shaded conditions. When planting tubers they can be soaked 12 hours in lukewarm water before planting. Always plant tubers (2 to 3 inches deep) on their sides as it is difficult to tell which end is up. They prefer a rich, well drained soil and a sunny, protected site. Some dappled shade is alright. 'Blue Star' and 'White Splendor' are recommended cultivars

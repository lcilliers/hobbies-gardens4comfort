Snowberry is a resilient plant able to withstand a variety of conditions. Snowberry plants are most commonly found in forests, dry or moist openings, rocky hillsides or near riverbanks and streams.[5] They have been known to grow in a variety of soil types such as light sandy soil, medium loamy soil and heavier clay soil.[5] Snowberry plants are also able to grow in a wide range of acidic and basic pHs and sunlight conditions.

 They have a very tough, hard, impermeable covering, and so are very hard to germinate and may lie dormant for up to ten years.

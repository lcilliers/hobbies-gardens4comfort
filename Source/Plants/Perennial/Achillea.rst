Propagation Notes
-------------------

 - Plant Type: Perennial 
 - Propagation: Seed 
 - Hardiness: Tender H7 - H10 (+0) 
 - Flowering Season: Mid summer 

The flowers of this vigorous yarrow slowly fade with age, making it a long lasting summer attraction to your beds or borders, perfect for the front to middle of a sunny mixed border, it will thrive on a well-drained site, and grows well even on poorer drier soils once well established. Tough, reliable and very easy to grow
Seed can also be sown in February or March onto the surface of moistened seed compost in pots or trays kept in a bright, unheated greenhouse or cold frame. Keep the container covered with plastic until the seed has germinated.  Young plants raised in this way should not be planted out until all danger of frost has past.

2024-01-09: By now, Yarrow is well distributed in the garden, growing in several different places.

2023-11-05: The achillea spread well through the garden and seems to be survive the winters, although in some areas it did not come up again.  I think I am going to skip sowing them again next season to make some space for other plants.

2023-07-09: achillea in full flower, with multiple colours. it seems the plants only come into flower in their second or later years

2023-03-25: Second sowing of achillea germinating

2023-02-08: Achillea started to sprout after about 5 days.

2002-07-11: Want to take some root cuttings this year to see if I can move them to other places also.
This acheillea was continiously nibbled off by the rabit this year, with the result that it just did not flower.
I also divided some of the plant and moved it to the Woodlands. The new plants established well, but it may be too shady, or too close to the Silver Beach.

lambs ear stachys
-------------------
These low-growing perennial plants offer flower and foliage interest, making them ideal for the front of borders. They prefer sun and free-draining soils but are generally tough enough to cope with most conditions. The most commonly seen is the grey-leaved ground cover plant Stachys byzantina (lamb's ear), which is irresistably soft to the touch.

2023-03-19: The jasmin gets a lot of frost damage during the winter. this year I tried to be less invasive with cutting away the damage by just pulling off the dead leaves and trimming off the dead tips.  I am keen to see how it will flower this year.

Jasmin clotted cream
----------------------
Jasminum officiale ‘Clotted Cream’ has larger, cream-coloured flowers with a slightly stronger fragrance than the species. It’s ideal for growing up an arbour or around a seating area, where you can best enjoy its fragrance, particularly in the evening. Not fully hardy, it may need protection from frost in winter, although a sheltered, south- or west-facing wall may be shelter enough.

breadseed poppy
-----------------
Papaver somniferum, commonly known as the opium poppy or breadseed poppy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae. It is the species of plant from which both opium and poppy seeds are derived and is also a valuable ornamental plant, grown in gardens.

The true opium poppy is known as Papaver Somniferum L. and is a member of the poppy family papaveraceae. This family contains over 100 species with many varieties. Many are well adapted to alpine regions, where water is plentiful in the spring and the later summer is dry.

Of the many species of poppy, only a handful contain the opium alkaloids, Papaver Somniferum is the main species used for this. However, there are many cultural varieties of P. Somniferum, varying in the color of the flowers and seeds, time until harvest, size of the capsules, etc. This species is used for the production of poppy seeds and seed oil for baking.

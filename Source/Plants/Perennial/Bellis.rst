Daisy
-------
Use Bellis daisies to fill empty areas at the front of borders, or in rock gardens, where the blooms are sufficiently restrained to blend in. They also are a great option for cheering up an unloved corner or tired display. You can plant bellis daisy plug plants from August to overwinter and flower in early spring, or from spring for a slightly later flowering period.

Grow Bellis daisies in full sun to partial shade. Water weekly and feed fortnightly with a high potash fertiliser to encourage more flowers to form, and deadhead spent blooms to prolong the flowering season.

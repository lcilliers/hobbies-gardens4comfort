Chives
--------
A low maintenance perennial herb, chives are grown for their pungent, mild tasting leaves that are delicious when chopped up finely and mixed into a salad or added to other dishes – they go particularly well with potatoes and egg. Although they are primarily grown for their leaves, chives have edible pink flowers that make an attractive garnish for salads

Alcea are robust biennials or short-lived perennials with showy funnel-shaped flowers borne in tall, erect racemes in summer. Their tall spires look good grown against walls and fences and are stalwarts of cottage gardens. Hollyhocks can be cut for bouquets and you can even add the petals to salads or crystallise for cake decorations.

Fully hardy and flower in the second year after sowing.

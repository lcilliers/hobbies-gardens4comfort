Lobelia speciosa Cardinal flower
----------------------------------Are clump-forming perennials, often grown as annuals or biennials, with basal rosettes of pale to dark green, bronzy, red-flushed or dark red foliage. In summer and early autumn they produce dense, upright spires of two-lipped, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, purple or blue
Lobelia × speciosa is a hybrid designation that covers plants developed from L. fulgens, L. cardinalis and L. siphilitica. These hybrids are noted for having attractive green foliage (often flushed with red, purple or bronze), attractive flowers (shades of lavender, pink or red) and a long summer bloom period (July to September). Plants typically grow to 2 1/2' tall. Narrow-ovate leaves appear in a basal rosette in spring. Flower stems rise from the rosettes in July bearing showy, terminal, bracteate spikes of tubular flowers. Each flower (1-2" long) has two lips, with the three lobes of the lower lip appearing more prominent than the two lobes of the upper lip. The flowers are highly attractive to butterflies and hummingbirds.

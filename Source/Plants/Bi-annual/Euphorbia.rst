===========
               
These are shrubs, succulents and perennials some of which are semi-evergreen or evergreen, and annuals. The flower heads will consist of cup-shaped bracts, in various colours, they will usually each containing several flowers lacking typical sepals and petals. They are fully hardy to frost tender, min 5-15C, and will grow well in sun or partial shade with moist but well drained soil.

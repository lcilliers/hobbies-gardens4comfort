Brassica sylvestris ornament cabbage
--------------------------------------

This is the wild cabbage plant from which many types of vegetable have been bred - cabbage, sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, kohlrabi and more. It is a short-lived perennial which looks very similar to other wild brassicas, with evergreen leaves and yellow flowers. It is extremely variable but the lower leaves are large and fleshy, on stalks, often with several leaflets and a wavy or toothed edge, whilst the upper leaves are small, stalkless and narrow. The flowers become long green pods containing dark brown seeds. All parts are edible when young

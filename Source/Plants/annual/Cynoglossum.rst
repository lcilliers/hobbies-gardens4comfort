-------------------------------------------
Chinese Forget-me-not is classified as a perennial, biennial and cool weather annual, all depending on where grown.    

In warmer climates, planting should be done in an area that receives shade in the afternoon.  This cool weather annual will not perform at its best when situated in climates that experience long, hot summers.  The bloom period will decline in the late summer and not extend into the fall.  

Easily grown from seed, it can bloom in the first year and continues to reseed itself for many months of sky blue flowers.  Its self-seeding tendencies make some declare it as weedy.

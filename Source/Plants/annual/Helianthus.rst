Sunflower helianthus
----------------------

Sunflowers (Helianthus), with their familiar large yellow blooms, are easy and fun to grow, for children and adults alike. But why limit yourself to the traditional favourites? There’s a colourful array to choose from, in all sizes, both short-lived annuals and long-lived perennials. Ideal for cheering up summer borders and containers, they’re great for attracting wildlife too.

A new type of ‘teddy bear’ sunflower, with the same cuddly flowerheads but this time in a cool lemon yellow that contrasts beautifully with the dark green leaves. Sunflower ‘Gummy Bear’ has a multi-branching habit, producing numerous fluffy flowers at the top of each plant. Each 3-5 inch flowerhead is densely packed with petals and produces minimal pollen making it perfect for cutting. Its outstanding garden performance has been recognised with a Fleuroselect Gold Medal. Grow in borders or containers. Kids will love them! Height: 170cm (67in). Spread: 90 cm (35in)

Propagation Notes
-------------------

 - Plant Type: annual 
 - Propagation: Seed 
 - Hardiness: H2 - Half hardy
 - Flowering Season: July - Oct


Plant in full sun with a south-facing or west-facing aspect. Grows to about 1 meter.  Sow indoors from March - may. Plant out may June after last frost.

2024-10-01:  I was really disheartened by the struggle to keep these plants going, but when they started to flower they really become beatiful.  The real unique benefit of the flowers is they dry very well and we now have a good collection of dried stems in the house to lighten up the winter months. Drying them we hang them upside down for some time to properly dry and then they can be used in arrangements.

2024-06-15: The everlasting flowers had a hard time to get through the snail onslaught, repeatedly being eaten to bits.  however, I got a few plant through to maturity and planted them out in the a sunny bed

2024-03-01: Sow seed indoors in pods.

2024-02-15:  Receive some seed through the gardeners world subscription. have never heard of this plant, but it looks interesting.

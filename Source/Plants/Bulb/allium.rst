Golden Garlic, Ornamental Onion
---------------------------------

A vigorous little allium bearing dense clusters of star-shaped, golden yellow flowers from late spring. Neat clumps of grey-green, strap-like foliage are quick to establish and will rapidly spread to naturalize beneath shrubs and throughout woodland areas. Allium moly is easy to grow, needing little attention throughout the season, and returning in a bigger and better display each year. Height: 15cm (6") Spread: 5cm (2").

 - Propagation: Division 
 - Hardiness: Hardy H5-H1 (<-10) 
 - Flowering Season: Mid summer 

Alliums thrive in light sandy, well drained soil in full sun. Avoid planting in cold wet soils as the bulbs are prone to rot in these conditions. Plant allium bulbs at a depth of 10cm (4") and a distance of 10cm (4") apart. A slow release fertilizer can be added to poor soils at the time of planting to improve fertility. When growing alliums, plant them where the leaves of other plants will cover the base of their stems. This will hide the old foliage which dies back before flowering begins.

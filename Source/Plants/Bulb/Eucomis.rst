The best time to sow Eucomis seeds is in the spring, but you will also get a good take in the autumn. After you have prepared a compost mix of 3 parts John Innes seed ‘compost’ to 1 part perlite, use it to fill 4 inch deep pots or plug trays - the depth here is important for root and bulblet development.

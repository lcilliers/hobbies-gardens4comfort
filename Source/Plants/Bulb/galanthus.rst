snowdrop
----------
The snowdrop is a familiar spring flower, coming into bloom in January and flowering until March. Despite its long history in the UK, however, it may not actually be native here; it is a native of damp woods and meadows on the continent, but was not recorded as growing wild in the UK until the late 18th century.

Propagation Notes
-------------------

 - Plant Type: Bulb  - Propagation: Division  - Hardiness: Hardy H5-H1 (<-10)  - Flowering Season: Spring 
Division: Lift and divide clumps as the foliage turns yellow. Split the clumps into smaller pieces with as little disturbance as possible. Bulbs can also be planted singly at the same depth as they were on the soil.
Seed: Collect and sow seed as soon as they ripen. Germination should take place as the temperatures start to rise after winter.
2024-01-06: Got 10 Giant Elwesii bulbs as a present and planted them at this late stage into a pot.
2021-02-01: Snowdrops are pushing through in several places now,  did not get the yield of the hundred or so bulbs we planted last year.  Just dont know what is happening to the bulbs in the garden.  The yields of snowdrops at Foxgloves was so much better.
2020-02-08: Snowdrops has a great significance for Mari.  Not only signals it the start of the new season, it is often in full bloom on Mari's birthday
2003-02-15: The snowdrops were exceptionally beautiful this year - they had very full displays, especially under the trees where I decided to plant some of them in the green two years ago.

Gladiolus
===========
               
Gladioli Sword lily
---------------------
Gladiolus are cormous perennials with fans of sword-shaped or linear leaves and spikes of funnel-shaped flowers

Gladiolus are one of the most spectacular cormous plants that can be grown in most gardens.  Other than the fact they are so colourful, a big plus point in their favour is that they take up so little room for such a splendid display of flower from mid summer through until autumn.

Propagation Notes
-------------------

 - Plant Type: Bulb  - Propagation: Seperating cormlets  - Hardiness: Semi Hardy H6 (-10)  - Flowering Season: Summer to autumn 
Gladioli bulbs are actually classical textbook corms, in that the corm is an underground stem - modified as a storage place for the dormant season. With your Gladiolus corms, you will probably see a few 'buds' situated around the corm. The main flower stem is sent up from the centre of the top of the corm. Once the flower stem and foliage starts to grow above ground, it forms a new corm on top of the one that you have planted. The original corm dies off, and should be removed when storing for the winter.

The corms should be planted in spring at a depth of around 5-6in and preferably with a bed of sharp sand or grit under the corm. Plant after all frost have gone, unless in a mild frost area.

Storing Gladiolus for Winter. Once the foliage has died down - and before the risk of frosts, carefully fork the plants out of the ground and cut the old stems back to within a few inches of the ground. The stems may simply pull away from the corm. Remove the old withered corm from the base of the newly formed corm and dispose. It has fulfilled its function. It is of no further use. Allow the corms to dry - either in full sunshine, or in a light place in garden shed. After the papery skin has formed (do not peel it off) the Gladiolus corm can be stored in a dry frost-proof place. Placing the corms in a seed tray and covering with dry peat is ok. A few sheets of newspaper laid over the top will also be suitable.

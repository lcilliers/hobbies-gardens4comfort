Propagation Notes
-------------------

 - Plant Type: Bulb  - Propagation:   - Hardiness:   - Flowering Season:  
Frost hardy: the plant can tolerate temperatures down to about -5C or 23F.
2023-03-20: last wonder season the arum lily got frost damage and was then taken to the greenhouse.  Although it did not die back completely, it is damaged quite a bit.  Would like to repot before placing it back at the front door.
2022-03-19: The arum lily in the pot at the front door remained outside close to the front door wall.  It actually did not do too bad and even attempts to push out new stems very early in the season.
2020-06-16: By Arum lily corms and planted in a pot at the front door.

Bracken, Brake, Pasture brake
-------------------------------
This is a terrestrial fern with fronds to 1m.
This plant does not appear in the RHS Encyclopedia???; I asked for its name at the Hamton Court Show. It is the fern that appears wild in almost all the woodlands around us, and also in our garden in the areas that has not yet been cultivated. I have tried to transplant some of them, but found it very difficult.

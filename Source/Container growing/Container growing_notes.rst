Container growing
===================
2024:05:25: Over the past few years we did a lot of container gardening. This year I am focussing on getting as many of the containers planted out.  This does not take away that there are still a large number that is around and will need watering through the summer.
2001-03-10: I replanted this heather in a pot to see if it is possible to reestablish it. It needs significant pruning but I am concerned to cut it too much.
2001-02-25: I am also getting more creative and taking more initiative to create plants in groups in pots and baskets and to replace plants that has finish displaying there flowers such as hyacinths and daffodils.   Plants is slowly spreading through the house, but it is quite clear that many of the plants do not survive in the heated house.
2001-02-10: Decided to feed the spring bulbs and other pots today with a liquid fertilizer.  It may be still very early, but it could also give the plants a good boost.
2001-01-06: I planted some hyacinths that I recovered from the previous year in pots and put them in the conservatory - they made very long leaves and the flowers did not form very well. I read somewhere that hyacinths would not give a good second year display, and these bulbs should just be planted in the garden.  The bulbs are treated and is only really good for one year.  New new bulbs that I bought this year is looking very good in the pots and will be ready in a month or two.
1998-11-22: I saw the first signs of life in my new pots that I planted with bulbs this weekend. This is about three weeks after planting.
1998-11-01: I planted daffodils, hyacinths and tulip bulbs today in pots for some spring colour.  I guess it was quite ruff and ready, but we will see the results in the new year.  I also started to rake leaves and debris and realised that it is a really big task.

Pruning
=========
2001-02-17: Today we completed the winter pruning of the roses and shrubs in the scented garden. I noted that the grass has lots of moss and that we will have to think how to eliminate the moss in the lawn.
1999-05-02: I cut the Lylandii Cypresses to form, and it looks quite good. I think that is the way to go.
1998-12-13: The past two days we had very mild weather, some 8-12 degrees in the day. It was also a very lovely weekend and good to work in the garden. I continued to cut shrubs, the climbers against the walls and leaves.
1998-11-29: I have cut the roses and plants against the front walls of the house and the entrance today, and it looks much better, less overgrown. It seems that both me and Elmien prefers a 'structured' garden, don't like everything being overgrown.  This certainly will give us much to do on a continuous bases as there are so many plants to cut back in this garden.

Weather Notes
=============

2025-12-26: So far, for this 2025 winter season, we still have not had significant frost or temperatures below freezing and had above average daytime temperatures. Lots of plants that should have died down complete still have flowers and leaves.

2025-10-31: The summer what very hot and dry with long spells of no or little rain.

2024-03-22: weather is still quite cold, with nights just above freezing every now and then. Last night had some ice rain.  fortunately we did not have a solid frost in March.

2024-01-18: Temperatures dropping to minus 3 this week, no snow.  It would be interesting to see afterwards what happened to some of the plants that did survive the winter until now.  It seems that it is going to warm up again in a couple of days, so the cold is not prolonged for weeks on end

2024-01-07: Temperatures is likely to drop to below zero for the next couple of days at night with a light dusting of sleet tomorrow.

2023-12-30: For the majority of December night temperatures have been above zero and had limited winter damage.

2021-04-04: There is a threat of a cold spell next week. Will to to put out frost protection and it also means it will take another two weeks or so get get all the plants out into the garden.

2021-03-21: The winter was devastating for my over wintering plants. Begonia tubers did not make it and most of my autumn cuttings did not make it. I think I need to make cuttings earlier to ensure I get a better start for the plants

2021-02-14: The deep cold to -4 at night has been quite devastating for the plants in the greenhouse.  it is obvious that my greenhouse does not provide sufficient overwinter heat.

2002-10-19: We had first frost last night with a temperatures dropping on a clear sky night. Most of the the Dahlia's and buzy lilies did not make it. But the rest of the garden is still fine.

2002-04-28: It is late spring, we had almost a month of little rain, but it seems as if we will get some rain again this weekend.  I have literally planted out every container, basket or pot that I made over the past three years. The garden is very full, and is coming into colour everywhere. In general the garden is looking very good, with strong and healthy plants. Here and there would be something that is struggling. I feel relieved and in is greatly satisfying.

2001-01-02: I noticed that the frost and snow killed most of the late autumn growth and left a real winter garden behind.

2000-12-28: It snowed overnight - a good 10 cm.  Temperatures remained below -3 for most of the day from the 28 to the 31st. It was impossible to do anything outside. On the 1st it started to rain again and temperatures shot up to 5 and 6 degrees overnight.

2000-12-27: Tonight was the first night with real frost, and temperatures below freezing.

1999-03-11: We had two days of fairly intense frost. Have not really assessed the damage to the plants as many bulbs and other plants started to bud.

1998-11-16: A light frost is covering the plants and grass.

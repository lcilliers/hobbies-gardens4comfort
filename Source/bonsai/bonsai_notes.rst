bonsai diary
============


2024:05:30: The bonsai's are all doing well, except for two trees that did not make it through the winter.  I managed to a bit of pruning, especially to prick out the growing tips to prevent long stems.  I also updated the wiring.  they need daily watering and weekly feed.

2024-02-20: I can see the first signs of the trees starting to bud.

2024-02-18: Still no sign of any germinations in the plug tray.

2024-01-15: the tray of bonsai plugs is added to the seedling stand indoors and placed under lights.

2024-01-08: Over the last year I relied heavily on youtube to learn more about Bonsai, but today I took out the book from my shelves: Bonsai - practical advise and choosing and growing bonsai trees by Werner Busch.  The book is a treasure trove.

2023-11-15: Move all the bonsai trees to the outdoor table under the roof next the wall. Hopefully it would do better over winter with more light and less cold.

2023-10-22: planted all the remaining bonsai tree seed in pods and placed them under a sheet of plastic rapping in the greenhouse to see if they germinate toward spring.

2023-08-20: visited the recycle site with Gawie today and discovered a selection of salad bowels in wood and ceramic that I am planning to turn into Bonsai containers

2023-07-16: Rescued two acers in poor condition from the neighbours.  Both acers were grown in containers.  I replanted them after trimmer to roots and would grow them on to see if they survive.

2023-07-08: spent some time today shaping and wiring bonsai

2023-04-09: The only see that germinated from Dalida's kit is two pines.

2023-03-14: Planted Acer Rubrum - red maple; Pinus Mugo Pumilio - mouintain pine and Betula Pendula - silver birch seed

2023-05-22: First planting of silver birch to grow into a bonsai. Note this sowing has not germinated

2023-03-11: planted two Pinus Mugo (mountain pines) that have been over wintering in the greenhouse into bonsai pots.  they are now about 2 inches tall

2023-03-12: Pinus Halepensis. planted 2 Pines from the bonsai seed of Lizette. This pine is evergreen with needles all year round. Produce small codes and will loose these in the summer.  sown in February into the same bonsai pot.

2023-02-04: First sowing of Pinus Halepensis as bonsai. This seed germinated after two weeks in of the pods

2023-02-04: Juniperus: sown for use as bonsai. seed needs refrgination to germination. Soak seed.  This seed did not germinate.

2023-02-04: Redbud cercis Chinensis. First sowing as bonsai. Prepare seed by rubbing and soaking overmight. place in warm sunny position. Germination could take some time

2023-02-05: Discovered some trees in my garden to convert to bonsai.  A couple of years ago managed a maple from the seed of one of the trees in the garden. It is about 3 years old.  About 4 years ago there were several fig trees that grew from seed in the compost.  Two of these tress is ideal to turn into Bonsai. The other two is planted in large containers and is growing against the wall on the west.

2023-01-19: Received another gift with Bonsai seeds and instructions from Lizette and JC

2022-12-25: Dalida gave me a Bonsai starter pack for Christmas.  It inspired me  to rekindle my interest in growing bonsai.  It is something that will require focus an attention year after year,  It is also something that I can pass on to the children after I left this earth.

2022-05-22: Pinus Mugo Pumilio Mountain pine sowing. Planted to grow into a bonsai. This is a evergreen with a rounded spread and shape and dark green foilage.  2 Pines germinated and are growing

2001-02-05: The bonsai perished, probably because of drought.  The small pot just did not last and we did not check regularly enough.

2001-01-19: I got an Elm Bonsai with a bonsai book as a present on my Birthday. I always looked at these small trees in the shops and wondered if I should get into it.  Reading the book it is almost like a small child that one needs to care for.

Maple
=======
This Japanese Maple (Palmatum) gows in our garden and is a large tree. It has yellow leaves with an abundance of white flowers in summer.  In 2018 it had an abundance of seed by characteristic winged fruits and over the winter of 2018 many seedlings started to germinate

I saved a few and decided to grow them on
